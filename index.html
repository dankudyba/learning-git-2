     <h1>Wham! - Last Christmas</h1>
      <p>
			Last Christmas 
			I gave you my heart 
			But the very next day 
			You gave it away 
			This year 
			To save me from tears 
			I'll give it to someone special 

			Last Christmas 
			I gave you my heart 
			But the very next day 
			You gave it away (you gave it away)
			This year 
			To save me from tears 
			I'll give it to someone special (special)
	      
			Once bitten and twice shy 
			I keep my distance 
			But you still catch my eye 
			Tell me baby 
			Do you recognize me? 
			Well 
			It's been a year 
			It doesn't surprise me 

			(Merry Christmas) 

			I wrapped it up and sent it 
			With a note saying "I love you" 
			I meant it 
			Now I know what a fool I've been 
			But if you kissed me now 
			I know you'd fool me again 

			Last Christmas 
			I gave you my heart 
			But the very next day 
			You gave it away (you gave it away)
			This year 
			To save me from tears 
			I'll give it to someone special (special)

			Last Christmas 
			I gave you my heart 
			But the very next day 
			You gave it away 
			This year 
			To save me from tears 
			I'll give it to someone special (special)

			A crowded room 
			Friends with tired eyes 
			I'm hiding from you 
			And your soul of ice 
			My God I thought you were 
			Someone to rely on 
			Me? 
			I guess I was a shoulder to cry on 

			A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
			A man undercover but you tore me apart 

			Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again 

			Last Christmas 
			I gave you my heart 
			But the very next day 
			You gave it away (you gave it away)
			This year 
			To save me from tears 
			I'll give it to someone special (special)

			Last Christmas 
			I gave you my heart 
			But the very next day 
			You gave it away 
			This year 
			To save me from tears 
			I'll give it to someone special 

			A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
			A man under cover but you tore him apart 
			Maybe next year I'll give it to someone 
			I'll give it to someone special.
			(Special. Someone. Someone.)
			I'll give it to someone...

			Yeeaaa

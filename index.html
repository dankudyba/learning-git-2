     <h1>Wham! - Last Christmas</h1>
      <p>
			Last Christmas 
			I gave you my heart 
			But the very next day 
			You gave it away 
			This year 
			To save me from tears 
			I'll give it to someone special 

			Last Christmas 
			I gave you my heart 
			But the very next day 
			You gave it away (you gave it away)
			This year 
			To save me from tears 
			I'll give it to someone special (special)
	      
			Once bitten and twice shy 
			I keep my distance 
			But you still catch my eye 
			Tell me baby 
			Do you recognize me? 
			Well 
			It's been a year 
			It doesn't surprise me 

			(Merry Christmas) 

			I wrapped it up and sent it 
			With a note saying "I love you" 
			I meant it 
			Now I know what a fool I've been 
			But if you kissed me now 
			I know you'd fool me again
